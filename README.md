Herb is an interpreted language made in Java.

Dynamically typed and simple language, C and Javascript like syntax.

# Sample script :herb:
```
write "Hello World!";
write 5+2;

var a = 10;
var b = 20;
write a;
write b;
b = 50;
write b;
write b = 100;

var i = 0;

while (i < 10) { i = i + 1; write i;}

var c = 50;
var d = 50;
if (c == d) { write "Variable c is equal to variable d.";}

var e = 5;
var f = 10;
if (e != f) { write "Variable e is not equal to variable f.";}

for (var g = 0; g < 3;) { g = g + 1; write g;}
 
```

Yes, yes, the same problem with the creator.

The only way to fix this is to use an IDE.

The creator uses Eclipse IDE, the simplest out there.
